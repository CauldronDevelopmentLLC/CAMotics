CAMotics is an Open-Source software which can simulate 3-axis NC
machining. It is a fast, flexible and user friendly simulation
software for the DIY and Open-Source community.  CAMotics works on
Linux, OS-X and Windows.

At home manufacturing is one of the next big technology revolutions. Much like
the PC was 30 years ago. There have been major advances in desktop 3D printing
yet uptake of desktop CNCs has lagged despite the availability of â€‹cheap CNC
machines. One of the major reasons for this is a lack of Open-Source simulation
and CAM (3D model to tool path conversion) software. CAM and NC machine
simulation present some very difficult programming problems, as is evidenced by
30+ years of academic papers on these topics. Whereas, 3D printing simulation
and tool path generation are much easier. Such software is essential to using a
CNC.

Being able to simulate is a critical part of creating CNC tool
paths. Programming a CNC with out a simulator is cutting with out
measuring; it's both dangerous and expensive. With CAMotics you can
preview the results of your cutting operation before you fire up your
machine. This will save you time and money and open up a world of
creative possibilities by allowing you to rapidly visualize and
improve upon designs with out wasting material or breaking tools.

# Downloads
Packages for Windows, Linux and OSX can be found on the
[CAMotics Website](http://camotics.org/download.html).

# Building from Source
This section describes how to build CAMotics from source on Debian based
systems such as Ubuntu and Mint Linux.  If you are running Windows or OSX
it is much easier to simply install prebuilt packages which can be found
at http://camotics.org/download.html  There are also prebuilt Debian packages
you can try.

## Prerequisites
  - C!         - http://cbang.org/
  - Qt5        - http://qt-project.org/
  - SCons      - http://www.scons.org/
  - v8         - https://developers.google.com/v8/

On Debian based systems all the prerequisites, including those needed
by C!, can be installed with the following command line:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install scons build-essential qt5-default python-six \
      libqt5websockets5-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libnode-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \
      pkgconf git

## Building C! (cbang)
Clone the C! git repository, build the software using scons and set the
environment variable CBANG_HOME so the CAMotics build system can find it
later.  **You must install V8 or ChakraCore before this step.**

    git clone https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/cbang.git
    scons -C cbang
    export CBANG_HOME=$PWD/cbang

## Building CAMotics
Clone the CAMotics git repository and build the software using scons:

    git clone https://github.com/CauldronDevelopmentLLC/CAMotics.git
    cd CAMotics
    scons

## Building & Installing the Debian Package
In the CAMotics source code directory run:

    scons package
    sudo dpkg -i camotics_*.deb

## Build Warnings/Errors
If you get any build warnings, by default, the build will stop.  If you have
problems building, especially with warnings related to the boost library you
can ignore these warnings by building cbang and/or CAMotics with
`scons strict=0`.  This disables strict checking.  For example:

    scons -C cbang strict=0
    cd CAMotics
    scons strict=0

# Using CAMotics
If you've installed the Debian package you should find CAMotics in your menu
under Other.  Also you can simply run `camotics` on the command line.

If you did not install the package, open a command line, go to the directory
where you built CAMotics and run `./camotics`

# Try the Examples
Try out some of the examples in CAMotics's File -> Examples menu.

## No Icons in Menus in Linux
If you don't see icons in CAMotics menus in Linux try running the following
command and restarting CAMotics:

    gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/interface/menus_have_icons true
